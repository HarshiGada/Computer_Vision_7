Use K-means algorithm to segment an image


The objective of this project is to segment an image into different regions using the K-means clustering algorithm. We will perform image segmentation with a fixed number of clusters (k=4) and then experiment with varying values of k to observe how the segmentation changes.

Tasks Overview

Task 1: Download an image - Download an image that will be used for segmentation.

Task 2: Apply K-means clustering algorithm using k=4 - Use the K-means algorithm with k=4 to segment the image into 4 distinct regions.

Task 3: Vary the value of k and observe the effects - Experiment with different values of k (e.g., k=2, k=5, k=10, etc.) and analyze the segmentation results.


Prerequisites
To run the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2 package)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)


You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
